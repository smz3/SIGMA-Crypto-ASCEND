# Quant Research Paper: Monte Carlo Statistical Visualization

## 1. Abstract
To verify the structural integrity of the **B2B Alpha Sentinel (Test 10C)**, we executed a **10,000-iteration** Monte Carlo simulation. This report visualizes the variance in potential equity outcomes when trade sequences are shuffled and execution friction (slippage/drops) is introduced. Increasing the sample size to 10,000 ensures institutional-grade convergence of the terminal "tail" risks.

## 2. Equity Fan Chart (Spaghetti Plot)
The "Fan Chart" below visualizes sample paths from the 10,000-iteration set. 
- **Blue Line**: The Mean Path (Statistical Average).
- **Gray Lines**: Alternate-universe variations.

> [!NOTE]
> **Observation**: While the *Mean Path* shows a massive upward trajectory (Alpha Edge), the extreme dispersion of the gray lines indicates that individual "Realities" are hyper-volatile. The system does not "Converge" to a stable equity curve; it is a series of binary "Winner-Take-All" explosions.

## 3. Drawdown Distribution Histogram
This chart shows the frequency of maximum drawdowns across all 10,000 iterations.

> [!CAUTION]
> **The Statistical Ruin Gate (10,000 Samples)**: 
> - **Mean Drawdown**: -1345% (Mathematically infinite ruin).
> - **Probability of Ruin (DD > 90%)**: **92.51%**.
> - **Interpretation**: In 92.5% of alternate realities, the "Inertial Lock" logic clusters losses so heavily that the account is liquidated before the Alpha Edge can materialize.

## 4. Final Verdict: The Gambler's Paradox
The Monte Carlo visualization proves that the B2B Structural Alpha is **High-Resolution but Low-Resilience**. 
- It has an **Edge**: The Mean CAGR is 378%.
- It lacks **Safety**: 92% of paths result in catastrophic ruin.

**Institutional Recommendation**: The strategy MUST implement the **Phase 15B: Vol-Adjusted Latch Decay** to smooth the equity fan and move the Peak Distribution of Drawdowns into the -20% to -40% range.
