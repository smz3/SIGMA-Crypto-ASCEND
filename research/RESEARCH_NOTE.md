# Research Note: SIGMA-Crypto-ASCEND Methodology

**Author**: Quant Researcher (Strategy Builder)
**Concept**: Liquidity Stress Divergence (LSD) in Perpetual Markets.

## 1. First Principles: Why Markets Move
In Crypto Perpetuals, price discovery is driven by the hunt for liquidity. Leverage creates "Potential Energy" in the form of unrealized liquidations.

## 2. Core High-Probability Alpha
Our edge is exploited when **Participant Forced-Behavior** overrides "Rational Intent."

### A. Funding Stress (The Z-Score)
Extreme Funding Rates ($Z > 2.5$) indicate a **Crowded Trade**. The cost of carry becomes unsustainable, making the market brittle.

### B. Liquidation Sweeps (The Catalyst)
Large players cannot exit without slippage. They use **Liquidation Flushes** for the counter-party liquidity surge needed to exit or reverse. 

### C. The Sigma B2B Shield
By applying the **"Russian Doll" Fractal Hierarchy** (MN1 > W1 > D1), we only enter these liquidity sweeps when the macro-narrative provides structural protection.

## 3. Predicted Outcome
By providing liquidity exactly when the majority is being forcibly liquidated, we capture the mean-reversion "snap-back" with high statistical expectancy.
